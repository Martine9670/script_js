## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure **Node.js is installed**:

```bash
node -v

    Open a terminal in the project folder.

    Run each script:

node script_01.js
node script_02.js
node script_03.js

    Check the console output for results.

💡 Tips

    Use console.log to debug and check your data.

    Test each step before moving to the next.

    For large datasets, display only a few items at a time.

    Modify the arrays to experiment and see results update.

Happy coding! 💻✨
